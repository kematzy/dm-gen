dm-gen
======

dm-gen is a collection of generators for DataMapper, to allieviate the need to
type boilerplate code to get started on a project. dm-gen uses templater
(http://github.com/jnicklas/templater) as a base.

Currently it supports only one generator, the 'one file' generator.


one_file
--------

The one file generator generates a single file, which sets up a connection to an
in memory sqlite3 database, along with debug logging and a example model, which
it then automigrates.  One file scripts are great to use as demonstration,
either of a bug, or just how to do something.
